# Gemerator

A way to simplify the creation of a gem skeleton.

## Overview

Inspired someway in the way that Gradle init task create Java Project Structure, this tool emulates that
but following prompt steps through a CLI. The structure created follows the requirements I put in a
[gist](https://gist.github.com/enchf/f63b77b010a5b0f1882d22b2d07e661e) some days ago.

First install the gem:

`gem install gemerator`

Then run the gem as:

`gemerator --name <gem-name>`

It will dispatch the prompt to create your gem step by step.
