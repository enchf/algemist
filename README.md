# Gemminator

A custom way to simplify the creation of a gem skeleton.

## Overview

Inspired in `bundle gem` command, I went deeper and put my personal settings.
Also, some `bundler` generated files offend certain Rubocop rules.
Some rules of the gem were listed on a gist sometime ago:
[gist](https://gist.github.com/enchf/f63b77b010a5b0f1882d22b2d07e661e).

## Installation and Running

First install the gem:

`gem install gemminator`

Then run the gem as:

`gemminator --name <gem-name>`

It will dispatch the prompt to create your gem step by step.
